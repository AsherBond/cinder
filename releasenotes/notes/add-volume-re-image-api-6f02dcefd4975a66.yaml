    Add microversion 3.68 to support ability to re-image a volume with a
    specific image. Specify the ``os-reimage`` action in the request body.

    The 'available' and 'error' volume can be re-imaged directly, and the
    'reserved' volume can only be re-imaged when the `reimage_reserved`
    parameter is set to 'true'. When reimaging a volume, the volume state
    will be changed to ``downloading`` first.

    Note that this is a destructive action, that is, all data currently
    contained in a volume is destroyed when the volume is re-imaged.

    Two new policies are introduced to govern this functionality:

    * ``REIMAGE_POLICY`` - users who satisfy this policy may re-image a volume
      in status ``available`` or ``error``
    * ``REIMAGE_RESERVED_POLICY`` - users who satisfy this policy may re-image
      a volume in status ``reserved``

    The default setting for both policies allow an administrator or the volume
    owner to perform the associated action.  See the `Policy configuration
    <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/yoga/configuration/block-storage/policy.html>`_
    documentation in the `Cinder Service Configuration` guide for details.
