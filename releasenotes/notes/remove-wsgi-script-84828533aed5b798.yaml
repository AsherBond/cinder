upgrade:
  - |
    The WSGI script ``cinder-wsgi`` has been removed. Deployment tooling should
    instead reference the Python module path for this service,
    ``cinder.wsgi.api``, if their chosen WSGI server supports this (gunicorn,
    uWSGI) or implement a ``.wsgi`` script themselves if not (mod_wsgi).
