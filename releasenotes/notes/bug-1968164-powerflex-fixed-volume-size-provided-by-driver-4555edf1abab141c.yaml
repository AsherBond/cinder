    PowerFlex driver `Bug #1968164 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1968164>`_:
    Fixed the display of the incorrect volume size on volume or snapshot creation.
    PowerFlex storage requires volumes sizes to be a multiple of 8 GiB. This size 
    was being reported to the end user, potentially causing confusion by being 
    different than what they requested.
