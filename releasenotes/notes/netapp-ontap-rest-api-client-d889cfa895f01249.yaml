    NetApp drivers: NFS, iSCSI and FCP drivers have now the option to request
    ONTAP operations through REST API. The new option `netapp_use_legacy_client`
    switch between the old ZAPI client approach and new REST client. It is
    default to `True`, meaning that the drivers will keep working as before
    using ZAPI operations. If desired, this option can be set to `False` connecting
    with new REST client that performs REST API operations if it is available,
    otherwise falls back to ZAPI.
